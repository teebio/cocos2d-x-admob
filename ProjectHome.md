This is an extension to the famous cocos2d-x C++ framework that allows easy integration of the AdMob SDK.

Currently the code supports the following subset of cocos2d-x platforms:
  * Android (interfacing the AdMob SDK through JNI)
  * Windows (really is just a stub that can be used to test ad placement on your desktop)

This extension is compatble with cocos2d-x version 2.x.x.
